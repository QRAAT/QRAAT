This is comprised of software for the Quail Ridge Automated Animal Trackking
(QRAAT) project. It remains under major development, but is distributed nonetheless 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, in the hopes that it will 
be useful. 

The RMG module (as we have been calling it) is a signal processing block that works
in the GNU Radio framework. After building and installing, the following programs 
are made available from the command line: 

  4channel_spectrum 
  4channel_spectrum_{serv,client}
  tx_setup
  run_rmg
  read_det
  active_rmg

For usage instructions, refer to the documentation. 

Installation
------------
A more lengthy and useful set of instructions is available in our documentation. 
However, these simple instructions should suffice if you know what you're doing. 

./build-gnuradio
<Will take about an hour for a full download/build/install>

vi ~/.bashrc
<PYTHONPATH to .bashrc, as suggested at the end of the last script>

./install-rmg install
<build/install Todd's code>
