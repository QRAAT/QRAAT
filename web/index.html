This is the future site of QRAAT, an automated animal tracking system deployed 
at the Quail Ridge natural reserve in Napa Valley, CA. QRAAT is an interdisciplinary 
effort intended to provide useful tracking and behavioral data for a wide variety 
of target species by using tiny radio transmitters. This project is in 
active development. We'll have some useful stuff for you on this page eventually.
