# Notes
# 
# Meta data (transmitter file, log files, etc.) is stored persistently on
# disk on the RMG remotes, typically in /home/rmg. Data (.det files, 
# status.txt) is written in memory to ramdisk, typically /tmp/ramdisk/det.
# 
# We make heavy use of SSH. To avoid entering passwords all the time, we 
# use an RSA encryption key with no passphrase. The public key is stored 
# at all RMG remote sites in /home/rmg/.ssh/authorized_keys; the private 
# key is kept at the server. This is because the remotes run the SSH 
# daemon. 
#     The key is assumed to be ~/.ssh/rmg_rsa. 
#
# Tasks 
# 
#  'up/down'
# 
# Power the physical hardware on and off. The relevant components are the 
# RMG receiver and the host computer, called the "RMG remote". The power
# supply for these will run through a network addressible hub. Theoretically,
# we should be able to tell this device to turn it sattached components on 
# and off. 
#     'up' does nothing special, but 'down' will SIGINT the run_rmg program 
# if it's running. Next, it sends the RMG remote the halt signal, waits a 
# sufficient amount of time (say 5 seconds), and powers the computer off. 
#     A list of up sites is stored in $(pwd)/up_sites. 
#
#  'start/stop'
# 
# Run and kill the pulse detector module (run_rmg). Output is logged in a 
# file in the meta data directory.
#
#  'fetch' 
#
# Download pulse data (.det files) from RMG remote to RMG server. Upon 
# success, erase the transfered data from the RMG remote. The pulse detector 
# in the RMG module emits .det files into a directory structure like 
# YYYY/MM/DD/HH/mm/ssuuuuuu.det. We want to be able to copy these files from 
# RMG remotes to the server, but exclude the directory that is being mutated. 
#       One solution would be to implement a hot-directory locking 
# mechanism on the RMG remote side. Since we don't want to burden the site 
# computers with this extra work, we decided to take advantage of the fact 
# that the real clock time must be synchronized across all nodes of the 
# network. We fetch all directories that are older than one minute because 
# the pulse detector will never mutate these directories again. 
#
#  'updatetx' 
#
# Update transmitter information on specified sites. This task includes an
# option to specify a file. 
#
#  'cyclerx'
#
# Cycle the power on the RMG module.  
#
# TODOs 
# 
# - Run task on 'all' sites. 
# - 'cyclerx', 'up', 'down'.

usage: rmg task [-options] {sites}/all  

  This program is part of the QRAAT system. It provides basic controls
  for RMG computers/receivers running in the field. Perform a batch job
  on a list of sites. If 'all' is provided, the job will be dispatched to 
  all up sites.   

  'task' is any one of the following: 

    up           Power on remote computer and RMG receiver. If no arguments
                 provided, print sites currently up. 

    down         Power off remote computer and RMG receiver. 

    start        Sart RMG software defined radio. Store pulse data remotely. 

    stop         Stop running RMG software defined radio. 

    fetch        Download pulse data from site to server. Delete downloaded 
                 data from remote machine. 
    
    updatetx --file FILE    Update transmitter file on remote computer. 
                            Defaults to 'tx.csv' in working directory.

    cyclerx      Power off the RMG receiver and power it back on.

    help         Print this.
