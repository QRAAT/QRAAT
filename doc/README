We use Sphinx to generate documentation for our code. This directory contains a
makefile for building complete docs exported in HTML, Latex, and other popular 
formats. The Python sources are all directly documented with Sphinx. The C++ 
source code is documented by importing doxygen XML output into Sphinx via a 
Python library called Breathe. 

I've already added the doxygen build directives to the make file. To build all
of the documentation, do 

 $ make clean && make html



Here's how I setup doxygen/breathe/sphinx: 

(1) Download breathe 4.2.0 here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/breathe. Untar it
    and run ``sudo python setup.py install``. 

(2) Next, generate a doxygen configuration file for the C++ interface files. 
    ``sudo apt-get install doxygen python-sphinx``.  
    In include/, do ``doxygen -g doxygen.cfg``. Move doxygen.cfg to doc/.

(3) Set the following parameters in doxygen.cfg: 
      PROJECT_NAME           = "RMG Pulse Detector"
      INPUT                  = ../include/
      GENERATE_HTML          = NO
      GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
      GENERATE_XML           = YES
      XML_OUTPUT             = doxyxml

(4) (The following instructions are from michaeljones.github.io/breathe/quickstart.html.)
    Add breathe to the Sphinx extensions list in doc/conf.py: 
      extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 
                    'sphinx.ext.pngmath', 
                    'sphinx.ext.viewcode', 
                    'breathe']

(5) Add the doxygen XML exports to the breathe path in doc/conf.py: 
      breathe_projects = { 'detector' : os.path.abspath('doxyxml/') }

(6) Set 'detector' as the default breathe project: 
      breathe_default_rpoject = "myproject"
